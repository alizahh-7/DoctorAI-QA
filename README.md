# ü©∫ MedGPT-HealthQ

**Developed by:** syedazah777  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Fine-tuned from:** unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-unsloth-bnb-4bit  

MedGPT-HealthQ is a GPT-OSS model **fine-tuned on healthcare datasets** using LoRA and [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) for fast, reasoning-based question answering. It provides **accurate, human-readable answers** to healthcare questions and is designed for **educational and demonstration purposes**.

---

## ‚ö° Features

- Fine-tuned on healthcare data for **disease, symptoms, and health advice Q&A**  
- Fast reasoning using **LoRA** + Unsloth optimizations  
- Interactive testing via **Colab** or **Gradio**  
- Supports multiple healthcare topics like diabetes, hypertension, heart health, and more
